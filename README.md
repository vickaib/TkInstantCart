'Instant Cart' is based off a simple shopping cart application from a prior class assignment. The layout for the application used minimal styling and an inefficient interface using TKinter. Additionally, the code is contains excessive comments and doesn't follow a neat structure.

My goal for 'New Instant Cart' is to take the same codebase and improve styling and efficiency.
