# Instant Cart

## Description
Based off a simple shopping cart application from a prior class assignment. The layout for the application used minimal styling and an inefficient interface, with too many windows to navigate and not enough information presented at a time. Additionally, the code is contains excessive comments and doesn't follow a neat structure. My goal for 'New Instant Cart' is to take the same codebase and improve styling and efficiency. 
- Added DessertShop.py. I tested the functionality of adding radio buttons using a local list and outputted them using the same methods as the Instant Cart app. With a working smaller application, it will help with debugging the main program.

## Challenges
- Replace Label function with Radiobutton when outputting grocery items list.
- Store values and have them outputted in the textbox area.
- Utilize pack() along with grid() to ensure widgets are packed together to get the desired format.
